(ns identity.authenticators
  "did を軸に、認証方法を重ねる — factors bind TO a DID; they are not where it comes from.
  ## The axis

  A `did:key` is this workspace's portable name: it is derived from a key pair,
  survives the machine it was made on, and is verifiable by anyone holding only
  the public half. A passkey, TouchID, a TOTP seed or a CACAO signature are
  **ways of proving a person is present** — each one is bound to a hardware
  authenticator, a browser profile, or a device, and each can be added and
  removed. Deriving the identity FROM one of them makes the name as mortal as
  the credential: replace the phone and you are somebody else.

  So the DID is the subject, and authenticators layer on top of it. Adding or
  revoking one leaves the DID untouched — which is the whole point, and is
  asserted directly by `did-survives-binding-changes` in the test suite.

  ## What this decides, and the three things it must not

  It answers ONE question: *is this authentication decision about THIS did, and
  did it come from an authenticator this did has bound?*

  It does not combine factors into a level — `authentication.core/decide`
  (`kotoba-lang/authentication`) does, and it already understands
  `:authn.request/required-level`. It does not decide whether a held authority
  covers a requested scope — `authority/chain-authorize` does. It does not
  decide whether a runtime may act at all — `identity.startup` does. Four
  questions, four owners; this namespace consumes a decision rather than
  reaching one, which is why it needs no crypto and no factor vocabulary of
  its own.

  ## The closed set is the caller's

  `factor-types` is passed in rather than defined here, for the same reason
  `biscuit.kotoba/->delegated` takes `kinds`: the vocabulary belongs to the
  semantics, and a copy in a second repo is a copy that can disagree. A factor
  outside the given set is REJECTED, never ignored — ignoring one silently
  drops a restriction somebody meant."
